# Orchestrator Control Plane

This package hosts the first control-plane skeleton for `review-then-codex-system`.

Current scope:

- requirement freeze and architecture freeze contracts
- task graph and task envelope persistence
- task-loop state rules with gate-aware transitions
- evidence ledger and gate result recording
- a typed bridge client boundary for `chatgpt-web-bridge`

The orchestrator does not drive a full agent runtime yet. It persists run state to files and exposes service boundaries that can later back an API or a workflow runtime.
